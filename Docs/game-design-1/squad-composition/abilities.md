# Abilities

## User story

As a player I want to be able to use my army in different and unique ways depending on the strategy I want to use on every battle by equipping different sets of abilities to my squads.

## Overview

We understand as ability any type of action executed by an unit. In our game everything is an action that the player can equip on their squads, even the movement! This way we allow the player a huge amount of freedom and ownership on their own playstyle.

The main intention behind converting something as basic as the movement on an ability is allowing the players to equip whatever they want and converting every squad in their army in whatever they can imagine. We want to allow crazy combinations and encourage experimentation as much as possible.
