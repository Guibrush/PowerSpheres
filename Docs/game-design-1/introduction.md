# Introduction

Power Spheres is a multiplayer combat game in which two players engage in battle with their own personalised armies with the goal of defeating the enemy.

**The game has two equally important aspects: building your own army and going into battle**. This two aspects are intimately interconnected in the sense that whatever the player does in one it directly affects the other. The type of stats, weapons or abilities \(all of this in the form of Power Spheres\) the player chooses to equip in their army is going to affect the way the player approaches the tactics of the battle; in this way, by building their own armies the players are choosing their own playstyle. On the other hand, how well the player does in battle is going to affect the rewards earned at the end of the battle. Those rewards are later used to enhance the equipment of your army. This way, the performance on the battlefield is going to affect the type and quality of items the player can equip on their armies.

## Building your own army

Each army is divided in squads and every squad is formed by a certain number of units. The units initially doesn't do anything by themselves, they don't have weapon, don't move and they don't have attack or defence. The two stats every unit in the game has are Health and Vision Radius; **the most basic thing an unit can do is being alive or dead and spot the enemy**.

To personalise their armies, the player has to equip Power Spheres to their squads. Every Power Sphere applies some effect or equip something to the units forming the squad. If there are special units forming the squad, the player can equip Power Spheres on special slots inside the squad to apply them only to those special units. The number and type of units on a squad is chosen by the player, this way we are allowing more options to customise the armies.

The Power Spheres can grant any type of benefit to the units inside the squad. They can be weapons, movement capabilities, special abilities or additional equipment. They can also be passive effects like increasing Health, Attack or Vision Radius. While there are certain restrictions on how many and what type of equipment and abilities can be equipped per squad, there are absolutely no restrictions on how many or what type of passive effects can be equipped to a given squad. This allow the players to come up with a wide range of different armies and tactics to win the battle.

However, the player cannot equip an infinite amount of Power Spheres. Each Power Sphere has a point cost and every time a Power Sphere is applied to a squad that point cost is multiplied by the number of units affected and added to the total point cost of the whole army. That point cost is used to determine the size and type of battles the player can play and to match players with more or less the same amount of point cost on their armies.

With each battle played, regardless of if it was won or lose the player gets experience points \(or XP\) that they can use to enhance their Power Spheres. This enhancement usually means better stats or the addition of some new effect but also increases the point cost of the Power Sphere. This way the player can improve the effectiveness of their army but they will also have to face stronger opponents in future battles.

## Going into battle

Once the player has build an army, that player can go into battle using that army. Going into battle means facing another player army against a common goal. The first player that achieves that goal, wins the battle.

Is in this moment when the benefits given by the equipped Power Spheres are applied to the squads. That ideally is going to determine the tactics used by the player to win the match. If one player has equipped a big amount of Power Spheres with sniper rifles and attack boost it means that player is going to try to kill units from far away dealing a lot of damage per shoot. If another player has equipped Power Spheres with close combat equipment and a lot of defence it probably means that player is going to try go as near as possible to the enemy absorbing as much damage as possible with the high defence.

The goal of the battle however is not killing every enemy unit. Usually the goal of the battle is something more elaborate like capturing and holding a position, collecting X number of tokens or destroying an important enemy command centre. This goal is determined by the type of game and map selected by the players when they enter in the match. Normally is useful to kill enemy units but the game rules should never encourage this over the main goal of the match, whatever it is.

When the battle ends, each player receives a certain amount of experience \(or XP\) depending on how well they did in battle. Things like number of units killed, damage done, healing done, time on the objective, etc are counted to make the final XP value for every player. While the player who won the battle will usually get more XP, both of them receives some amount of it independently of the result of the battle. This XP can be used later to improve the player's Power Spheres and keep growing their army.
